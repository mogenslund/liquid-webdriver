# Liquid Webdriver Test

This is a sample project, both to show how to create browser tests using Selenium Webdriver and how to use Liquid to design tests and evaluate forms to make test development easier.

Just clone this project and run

    lein liq

(requires Leiningen)

Follow the instructions on the first page.

It has only been tested on Linux, so adjustments might need to be made to make it work on Windows.

To run on mac you might need to replace the chromedriver with the Mac one from here:
